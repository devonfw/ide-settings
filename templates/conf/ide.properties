# Uncomment the following line to use your shared maven repository.
# This will save diskspace but comes with the risk that other projects could
# accidentally (or due to an security attack) access and use artifacts from this project.
# If you are working in a project that is highly sensitive never use this feature.
#export M2_REPO=~/.m2/repository

# In case you are sitting behind a proxy these JVM options may help:
#export JAVA_OPTS=-Dhttp.proxyHost=myproxy.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080

# Uncomment if you always want to clone via ssh instead of HTTPS
#PREFERRED_GIT_PROTOCOL=ssh

# If you are responsible for the IDEasy settings in your project, you might want to uncomment
# the following line to get more attention to misconfigurations
#FAIL_ON_AMBIGOUS_MERGE=true

# If you have crazy VPN tools interfering and causing errors on downloads you may try this workaround.
# However, downgrading to older HTTP versions can be a security problem so only use this when absolutely neccessary.
